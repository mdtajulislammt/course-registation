## 1. Question Add at least 3 Project features
-  Information representation and detailing highlights are important for projects that arrangement with information investigation, insights, or following different measurements. Incorporating outlines, diagrams, and intelligent dashboards can help clients comprehend and decipher information all the more really. Well known libraries like D3.js, Chart.js, or Plotly can be utilized to make outwardly engaging and educational information representations. Applications related to business intelligence, analytics, and data-driven decision making can benefit from this feature.

-  Your project gains a dynamic and engaging dimension from real-time features. Carrying out ongoing updates and notices permits clients to get moment input, messages, or updates without the requirement for manual revives. Real-time functionality can be achieved with the help of server-sent events (SSE) and WebSockets technologies. Models incorporate continuous visit applications, live warnings, and cooperative apparatuses.


-  Executing a powerful client verification and approval framework is pivotal for projects that include client records and touchy information. It ensures that your project's data and features can only be accessed by authorized users. User registration, login, password recovery, and role-based access control are all possible features. Utilizing innovations like OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth2 can improve on this cycle.
 
## 2. Question Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

-Local State Management:
 For little to medium-sized projects, neighborhood state the board is frequently adequate. In this methodology, the state is put away and overseen inside the parts or modules where it's required. This can be accomplished utilizing factors or information structures inside the part's extension.

 - React's State Management (React.js):
 In React.js applications, state the board is many times done utilizing Respond's underlying useState snare. It permits you to oversee part unambiguous state. For more perplexing state the board needs, you can utilize outer libraries like Revival or Mobx, which give incorporated state the executives and permit you to share state across numerous parts.

 - Database and Backend State Management:
 In applications that include data sets and server-side rationale, the backend regularly deals with the condition of the application's information. APIs and databases are used to accomplish this. Frontend parts speak with the backend to recover and refresh the condition of the application.


-State Machines:
 At times, state machines are utilized to display and deal with the application's way of behaving. State machines characterize a bunch of states, changes among states, and activities related with each state progress. Libraries like XState are regularly utilized for this reason.

 -Persistent State:
 Data is frequently stored in databases or cloud storage services in projects that require data persistence between sessions, such as mobile apps or web applications with user accounts. Confirmation tokens and meeting information assist with keeping up with the client's state across numerous meetings.
